<p>Chandlers have been producing candles for more than 5,000 years. Lighting the path when night fell became an integral part of human life. They were also quickly integrated into ceremonial practices soon after. As time has progressed, candles have taken on many shapes and meanings, while light and warmth have continued to be essential to us. Beyond the physical, candles also carry a spiritual quality for those who seek it.</p>
